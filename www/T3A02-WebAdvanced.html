<font color = black>There lived a certain man in Russia long ago<br>
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow<br>
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear<br>
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear<br>
He could preach the bible like a preacher<br>
Full of ecstacy and fire<br>
But he also was the kind of teacher<br>
Women would desire<br><br>

RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Lover of the Russian queen<br>
There was a cat that really was gone<br>
RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Russia's greatest love machine<br>
It was a shame how he carried on<br><br>

He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar<br>
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar<br>
In all affairs of state he was the man to please<br>
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze<br>
For the queen he was no wheeler <br>
Though she'd heard the things he'd done<br>
She believed he was a holy healer<br>
Who would heal her son<br><br>

RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Lover of the Russian queen<br>
There was a cat that really was gone<br>
RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Russia's greatest love machine<br>
It was a shame how he carried on<br><br>

[Spoken:]<br>
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger<br>
for power became known to more and more people,<br>
the demands to do something about this outrageous<br>
man became louder and louder.<br>

"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies<br>
But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please"<br>
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms<br>
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms<br>
Then one night some men of higher standing<br>
Set a trap, they're not to blame<br>
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding<br>
And he really came<br><br>

RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Lover of the Russian queen<br>
They put some poison into his wine<br>
RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Russia's greatest love machine<br>
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"<br><br>

RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Lover of the Russian queen<br>
They didn't quit, they wanted his head<br>
RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Russia's greatest love machine<br>
And so they shot him till he was dead<br>

[Spoken:] Oh, those Russians...</font></td></tr></table>
